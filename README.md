# Topic Modeling

### Developing the Topic Model

1. **Dataset**: Use the dataset provided to perform topic modeling.
2. **Text Preprocessing**: This involves cleaning the text data (e.g., removing stopwords, stemming, lemmatization).
3. **Creating a Topic Model**: Use methods like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or any other preferred method.
4. **Analyzing Results**: Focus on identifying key themes or topics within the dataset and understanding the underlying patterns.

## Python Packages Used

The following Python packages were utilized in this project:

- **Pandas** (`pandas`): Used for data manipulation and handling of structured data.

- **Regular Expressions** (`re`): Used for text cleaning and preprocessing tasks such as removing unwanted characters or patterns.

- **Gensim** (`gensim`): A robust library for topic modeling and document similarity analysis.
  - `corpora`: To create a dictionary and corpus needed for topic modeling.
  - `LdaModel`: For building the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model.
  - `CoherenceModel`: To measure the coherence of the topics generated by the LDA model.
  - `Phrases`: To detect and form bigrams and trigrams in the text.
  - `simple_preprocess`: For preprocessing text data into a list of tokens.

- **NLTK** (`nltk`): A comprehensive library for natural language processing.
  - `stopwords`: To remove common words that may not add value to the text analysis.
  - `WordNetLemmatizer` and `SnowballStemmer`: For lemmatizing and stemming text to reduce words to their base form.
  - `pos_tag`: For part-of-speech tagging to determine the part of speech for each token.
  - `wordnet`: A lexical database for the English language to assist with lemmatization.

- **pyLDAvis** (`pyLDAvis`): A visualization library for LDA models to help interpret the topics by visualizing the distributions.
  - `gensim_models`: An integration module to visualize Gensim LDA models.
